## Research

\
I joined the Fay Lab in the fall of 2021. I am a Marine Biologist with a Master degree in Fisheries Science from the University of Concepcion (UdeC-Chile). I have been working since 2016 at Instituto de Fomento Pesquero (IFOP-Chile) providing scientific advice for the yellownose skate and southern hake stock assessments and also participate as a researcher in the scientific committees for the demersal fisheries. My topics of interest are Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE), population rebuilding, ecosystem- based fisheries management, and sustainable fisheries.
